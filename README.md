<h1><b>Delta Latent Space Vectors</b></h1>

Implementation of paper "Exploring molecular heteroencoders with latent space arithmetic: atomic descriptors and molecular operators" by Xinyue Gao, Natalia Baimacheva and Joao Aires-de-Sousa

<b>Prerequisites:</b> CDDD (https://github.com/jrwnter/cddd)

<b>Files:</b>
  - dlsv.py - script to calculate delta latent space vectors for atoms in molecules represented by SMILES strings.
  - plot_ar_1.html - interactive t-SNE map of atoms represented by DLSV, labeled with aromaticity.
  - plot_el_1.html - interactive t-SNE map of atoms represented by DLSV, labeled with atomic element.
  - plot_hi_1.html - interactive t-SNE map of atoms represented by DLSV, labeled with hybridization.
  - plot_ty_1.html - interactive t-SNE map of atoms represented by DLSV, labeled with atom type.
